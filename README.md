This project works with four different datasets collected from below Starvation Reservoir, the Uinta River, the Whiterocks River, and the Yellowstone River. I loaded, processed, and plotted each dataset, then resampled the data into weekly and monthly volumetric totals and plotted those against each other for comparison. Finally, I completed a comparative analysis between flows below the Starvation Reservoir and the headwater catchment (the Uinta River), focusing on a wet year (2005) and a dry year (2002).
